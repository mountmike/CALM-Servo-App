# CALM-Servo-App

A full stack group project from 4 students as part of GA's Software Engineering Immersive program. The goal was to make a single page application that you could use to search for petrol stations in your area using **Google Map's API**.

[Check it out!](https://calm-servo-app-wphj.onrender.com/) *(deployed on Render's free tier so may take half a minute for the server to spin up)*

**Backend:** Node.js/Express.js/EJS/

**Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript/Axios

**Other technology:** Google Maps & Places API/Commodities-API/Font Awesome
