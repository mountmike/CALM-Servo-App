# CALM-Servo-App

A full stack group project from 4 students as part of GA's Software Engineering Immersive program. The goal was to make a single page application that you could use to search for petrol stations in your area using **Google Map's API**.

[Check it out!](https://calm-servo-app-wphj.onrender.com/) *(deployed on Render's free tier so may take half a minute for the server to spin up)*

**Backend:** Node.js/Express.js

**Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript & Axios

**Other technology:** EJS/Google Maps & Places API/Commodities-API/Font Awesome

# The development process

Working in a team of 4, we used **git/github** for version control and **Trello** for organising our priorities. We utilised pair programming over Zoom for a lot of the more challenging tasks/features and also divided and conquered when possible.

The whole project had to be completed in 4 days but it was a fun sprint with a great team.
